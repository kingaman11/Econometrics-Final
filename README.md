# Econometrics-Final

This project was done to fulfill the class final of taking Econometrics. We had to do an analysis on college students and gain an conclusion on the dataset through making our own question and understanding how to answer the question given what we learned in the class. We were required to this project in Stata which was a little different to R but not by that much.
